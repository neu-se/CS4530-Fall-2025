# Specifications for Live Demos or Presentations (Sections 7 & 8 - Prof. Mitra)

The schedule of these demos is provided on your section's calendars but the order of demos will be discussed/finalized during the lecture. You will have 20 minutes maximum (12-15 minutes to setup and present + 5-8 minutes for questions). You will lose points if your presentation goes over 15 minutes.
